# This document will have some information specific to this git repository.

### Naming Conventions
I will be adding files written by many people here, and when doing so I will start the filename with their ign (or discord username). 
For example:

wwg_sibling_rivalry.lua (a file shared by the developers at Wise Wizard Games used as an example in the Lua documentation)
ac13_orc_pauldrons.lua (a file from me 'agentc13', for the 'Orc Pauldrons' armor upgrade)
userkaffe_ranger_rebalance.lua (a file shared by 'userkaffe' with ranger balance changes)

I will be making some templates for market cards, item/armor upgrades, and other various kinds of things.  These will start with 'template_'.
