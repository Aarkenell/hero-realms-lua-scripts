# This document will have some information specific to this git repository.

### Naming Conventions

I will be adding files written by many people here, and when doing so I will start the filename with their ign (or discord username).
For example:

- wwg_sibling_rivalry.lua (a file shared by the developers at Wise Wizard Games used as an example in the Lua documentation)
- ac13_orc_pauldrons.lua (a file from me 'agentc13', for the 'Orc Pauldrons' armor upgrade)
- userkaffe_ranger_rebalance.lua (a file shared by 'userkaffe' with ranger balance changes)
- templates will start with 'template\_' (I will make these, but want to name them differently than my normal Lua files)
