# HR Lua Scripts

- [WWG Documentation] (https://www.herorealms.com/luascripting/)
- [Documentation in markdown format](https://github.com/agentc13/Hero-Realms-Lua-Scripts/blob/6eb883539212f71dea1410543a1cd0853b004485/Lua_documentation.md)
- [Instructions to contribute to this repo](https://github.com/agentc13/Hero-Realms-Lua-Scripts/blob/6eb883539212f71dea1410543a1cd0853b004485/contribute.md) (_This method uses the command line, but you can achieve the same through a GUI_)

## Folder Structure and Naming Conventions

I will be adding files written by other people than myself here, and when doing so I will start the filename with their ign (or discord username). The folder structure has separate folders for scripts provided by WWG, myself, and other community members. There are also folders for templates and image files (used in the Lua Documentation README.md).

For example:

`wwg_sibling_rivalry.lua` File shared by the developers at Wise Wizard Games used as an example in the Lua documentation.

`ac13_orc_pauldrons.lua` File from me 'agentc13', for the 'Orc Pauldrons' armor upgrade.

`userkaffe_ranger_rebalance.lua` File shared by 'userkaffe' with ranger balance changes.

`template_setupGame.lua` Template file with comments on what the lines of code do.

## Task List (Planned Projects)

- Templates

  - [x] Magic Armor (orc_pauldrons_carddef)
  - [x] Class upgrade (fighter_rallying_flag_carddef)
  - [x] Creating an Ability (createAbility)
  - [x] Game Buff/Debuffs or 'Battlefield Effects' (buff_debuff)
  - [x] Game setup (setupGame)
  - [x] Class Ability (piercing_screech_def)
  - [x] Class Skill (siphon_life_def)
  - [x] Market Card (snackforce_carddef)

- How to guides (these will be posted to YouTube and I will likely have a smaller text version here at some point)

  - [ ] Setting up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, really a fancy text editor).
  - [ ] Downloading the GitHub repo and adding it to to your IDE.
  - [ ] Editing existing .lua files (taking examples/templates and modifying them to do something).
  - [ ] Loading the file you made into the HR dev area, and testing it.
  - [ ] Setting up your own GitHub, making a fork of the repo, and submitting a pull request.

- Custom Game setup ideas (not all are necessarily possible or attainable within my skillset, but this is a working list of ideas)

  - [ ] Market card price change effects
  - [ ] Player health buff/debuff each turn
  - [ ] Healing debuff (lessen effectiveness by %)
  - [ ] Damage debuff (lessen effectiveness by %)
  - [ ] Missing factions from market
  - [ ] Modifier to champions defense (+/-)
  - [ ] Alternative to Fire Gems
  - [ ] Special skills/abilities for both players
  - [ ] Bonus effect when using sacrifice/or damage applied above a threshold
  - [ ] Events (custom market cards similar to SR events)
  - [ ] NPC cards (something like SR heroes, but we already have hero classes so it needs a different name)
  - [ ] Ally buffs (all or some ally abilities trigger every turn)
  - [ ] Different fatigue effects

- Custom Classes/Races

- Balance change ideas
