# Git Repo Notes

## Folder Structure and Naming Conventions

I will be adding files written by other people than myself here, and when doing so I will start the filename with their ign (or discord username). The folder structure has separate folders for scripts provided by WWG, myself, and other community members. There are also folders for templates and image files (used in the Lua Documentation README.md).

For example:

- wwg_sibling_rivalry.lua (a file shared by the developers at Wise Wizard Games used as an example in the Lua documentation)
- ac13_orc_pauldrons.lua (a file from me 'agentc13', for the 'Orc Pauldrons' armor upgrade)
- userkaffe_ranger_rebalance.lua (a file shared by 'userkaffe' with ranger balance changes)
- templates will start with 'template\_' (I will make these, but want to name them differently than my normal Lua files)

## Dev Branch

I have added a Dev branch to this repo. It is where I will put the lua files I am working on, but that are not yet finished. These are not ready for copying/use by the general public, and are a way for me to keep those files separate from the ones ready for use by the HR community.
